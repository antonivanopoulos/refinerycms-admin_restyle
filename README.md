# RefineryCMS::AdminRestyle

This gem will override the default admin layouts and css to provide an interface I've found a little more usable for client work.

- Plugins will now appear down the left side of the scren, as opposed to tabs along the top of the content area.
- The content area will now scale with the screen.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'refinerycms-admin_restyle'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install refinerycms-admin_restyle
